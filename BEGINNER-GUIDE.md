## What is a Homelab?

A **homelab** is a personal environment where you run services on your own hardware instead of relying on cloud providers like Google, Microsoft, or Amazon.

**Think of it like this:**
- Instead of paying Google for Drive -> You run Nextcloud at home
- Instead of using Google Photos -> You run Immich on your own server
- Instead of Netflix (but for your own media) -> You run Jellyfin/Plex

**Your homelab is:**
- A computer/server running 24/7 at your home
- Multiple "services" (apps) running in containers
- Accessible from your devices (phone, laptop, TV)
- Under YOUR control, not Big Tech

---

## Why Self-Host?

### Advantages

1. Privacy - Your data stays on YOUR hardware
2. Control - You decide what runs and how
3. Learning - Gain valuable tech skills
4. Cost Savings - Replace multiple subscriptions
5. Customization - Configure everything exactly how you want
6. Fun - It's genuinely enjoyable to build!

### Trade-offs

1. Time Investment - Initial setup takes time (worth it!)
2. Electricity Costs - ~$10-30/month depending on hardware
3. Maintenance - Updates, monitoring (can be automated)
4. Internet Dependency - Need good home internet
5. Learning Curve - New concepts to learn (we'll help!)

---

## Prerequisites

### What You NEED to Know (Before Starting)

####  Absolute Basics (Must Have)
- [ ] Use a computer - Navigate files, install programs
- [ ] Use a web browser - Click links, enter URLs
- [ ] Basic typing - Can edit text files
- [ ] Follow instructions - Read and execute steps in order

####  Helpful but Not Required (Can Learn Along the Way)
- [ ] Command line basics - Ever used Terminal/CMD?
- [ ] What an IP address is - Like 192.168.1.100
- [ ] What a port is - Like :80 or :443
- [ ] Copy/paste code - Into terminal or config files

#### You DON'T Need to Know (Yet!)
- Programming/coding
- Linux system administration
- Networking protocols
- Docker/containers (you'll learn!)

**If you can use a computer and follow directions, you can do this!**

---

## Understanding the Basics

Before we start, let's understand the key concepts:

### What is Docker?

**Simple explanation:**
- Docker is like a "shipping container" for apps
- Each app runs in its own isolated "container"
- Containers include everything the app needs to run
- You can start/stop/remove containers easily

**Why it matters:**
- Install complex apps in seconds (not hours)
- Each app is isolated (can't break each other)
- Easy to backup, move, or delete

**Analogy:**
- **Without Docker:** Installing 10 apps = 10 different installation guides, dependencies, conflicts
- **With Docker:** Installing 10 apps = Copy 10 folders, run `docker-compose up`, done!

### What is a Reverse Proxy? (Traefik)

**Simple explanation:**
- One entrance for all your services
- Routes traffic: "jellyfin.yourdomain.com" -> Jellyfin, "nextcloud.yourdomain.com" -> Nextcloud
- Handles HTTPS/SSL automatically
- Like a receptionist directing visitors to the right office

**Why you need it:**
- Access services with nice URLs (not IP:port)
- Automatic HTTPS certificates
- One place to manage access

### What is 2FA/SSO? (Authelia)

**Simple explanation:**
- **2FA** (Two-Factor Authentication) = Username + Password + Phone Code
- **SSO** (Single Sign-On) = Log in once, access everything
- Protects ALL your services with one login

**Why you need it:**
- Even if password leaks, attacker needs your phone
- Don't remember 20 different passwords
- Security without hassle

### What is DNS? (Pi-hole)

**Simple explanation:**
- DNS translates names (google.com) to numbers (142.250.80.46)
- Pi-hole = DNS server that blocks ads/trackers
- Every device on your network uses it

**Why you need it:**
- Block ads on ALL devices (even apps!)
- Block tracking/telemetry
- Faster internet (blocks = less data)

---

## Choosing Your Hardware

### What Can I Use?

You have several options:

#### Option 1: Old Laptop/Desktop ( Best for Easys)

**Perfect for:** Power users, multiple VMs, media transcoding

### Minimum Recommended Specs

For a good beginner experience:

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **CPU** | 2 cores | 4 cores |
| **RAM** | 4GB | 8-16GB |
| **Storage** | 32GB SSD | 128GB SSD + HDD for media |
| **Network** | 100Mbps ethernet | Gigabit ethernet |
| **Power** | N/A | UPS backup (optional) |

### Budget Recommendations

**$0 - Use what you have:**
- Old laptop gathering dust
- Desktop you're not using
- **Cost:** Free!

**$50-150 - Entry Level:**
- Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) + Case + Power Supply + SD Card
- **Services:** 5-10 lightweight services
- **Cost:** ~$100-150

**$300-600 - Sweet Spot:**
- Used/New Mini PC (e.g., Dell Optiplex Micro, Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny, Intel NUC)
- i5/Ryzen 5, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD
- **Services:** 20-30 services comfortably
- **Cost:** ~$300-600

**$800-1500 - Enthusiast:**
- Custom build or high-end Mini PC
- i7/Ryzen 7, 32-64GB RAM, NVMe SSD + HDD
- **Services:** Unlimited
- **Cost:** ~$800-1500

### My Recommendation for Easys

**Start with what you have!** 

1. Use an old laptop/desktop for 1-3 months
2. Learn the basics, see if you enjoy it
3. If you love it, upgrade to a Mini PC
4. If you go all-in, build a custom server

**Don't spend money until you know you'll stick with it!**

## Installing Docker

Docker is the foundation of your homelab. Let's install it!

### For Ubuntu/Debian Linux

```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install prerequisites
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

# Add Docker's official GPG key
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Set up the repository
echo \
 "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
 $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Install Docker Engine
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# Add your user to docker group (no need for sudo)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Log out and back in, then test
docker --version
docker compose version
```

### For Windows (Docker Desktop)

1. Download Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. Install and restart
3. Open Docker Desktop
4. Enable WSL 2 backend if prompted
5. Test in PowerShell: `docker --version`

### For macOS (Docker Desktop)

1. Download Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. Drag to Applications
3. Open Docker Desktop
4. Test in Terminal: `docker --version`

### Verify Installation

Run these commands:

```bash
# Check Docker version
docker --version
# Should show: Docker version 24.x.x

# Check Docker Compose version
docker compose version
# Should show: Docker Compose version v2.x.x

# Test Docker works
docker run hello-world
# Should download and run a test container
```

If all three work, you're ready!

## Your First Service: Portainer

Let's deploy your first service! We'll use Portainer - a web UI for managing Docker.

### Why Portainer First?

- Simple to set up
- Gives you a visual interface
- Helps you understand Docker
- Makes managing other services easier

### 1. Create a Directory

```bash
# Create directory for Portainer
mkdir -p ~/homelab/portainer
cd ~/homelab/portainer
```

### 2. Create docker-compose.yml

```bash
# Create the file
nano docker-compose.yml
```

Paste this content:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
 portainer:
 image: portainer/portainer-ce:latest
 container_name: portainer
 restart: unless-stopped
 ports:
 - "9000:9000"
 volumes:
 - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
 - portainer_data:/data

volumes:
 portainer_data:
```

Save with `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, then exit with `Ctrl+X`

### 3. Start Portainer

```bash
# Start the container
docker compose up -d

# Check it's running
docker ps
```

You should see portainer in the list!

### 4. Access Portainer

1. Open browser
2. Go to: `http://YOUR-SERVER-IP:9000`
3. Create admin account (username + password)
4. Select "Docker" environment
5. Click "Connect"

** Congratulations!** You just deployed your first self-hosted service!

### Understanding What You Did

- **docker-compose.yml** = Recipe for the service
- **docker compose up -d** = "Start this service in background"
- **Port 9000** = How you access it (IP:9000)
- **Volumes** = Where data is stored (persists after restarts)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Starting Too Big
**Mistake:** Trying to deploy 20 services in week 1 
**Solution:** Start with 3-5 core services, add more slowly

### 2. Ignoring Backups
**Mistake:** No backup strategy until data loss 
**Solution:** Set up backups by week 3, test restores

### 3. Weak Passwords
**Mistake:** Using "password123" or same password everywhere 
**Solution:** Use Vaultwarden to generate strong, unique passwords

### 4. Exposing Everything to Internet
**Mistake:** Port forwarding everything without VPN/2FA 
**Solution:** Use VPN or Authelia before exposing services

### 5. Not Reading Logs
**Mistake:** Service fails, give up without checking logs 
**Solution:** Always check: `docker compose logs -f`

### 6. Skipping .env Files
**Mistake:** Hardcoding secrets in docker-compose.yml 
**Solution:** Always use .env files for sensitive data

### 7. No Documentation
**Mistake:** Forgetting how you set things up 
**Solution:** Document as you go, future you will thank you

### 8. Updating Everything at Once
**Mistake:** Updating 20 services simultaneously, everything breaks 
**Solution:** Update one service at a time, test before next

### 9. No Testing Before Production
**Mistake:** Deploying untested configs to production 
**Solution:** Test in dev first, then promote to production

### 10. Giving Up Too Early
**Mistake:** First error = quit 
**Solution:** Errors are learning opportunities! Google, ask community, persevere
