# 🚀 Getting Started with Your Homelab

> **New to homelabs?** This guide will take you from zero to running your first services in under an hour!

## 📖 What is a Homelab?

A homelab is your personal server environment where you:
- Run self-hosted services (instead of cloud services)
- Learn new technologies
- Have complete control over your data
- Replace expensive subscriptions

**Think of it as:** Your own mini data center at home.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before starting, you need:

### Knowledge (Don't worry, you'll learn!)
- [ ] Can use a computer
- [ ] Comfortable typing commands
- [ ] Willing to learn from mistakes
- [ ] Can follow instructions

**That's it!** Everything else you'll learn along the way.

### Hardware (Use what you have!)
- [ ] Any computer (old laptop, desktop, Raspberry Pi)
- [ ] Internet connection
- [ ] 4GB+ RAM recommended
- [ ] 32GB+ storage

### Time Investment
- **Initial setup:** 2-4 hours
- **Learning curve:** 1-2 weeks
- **Maintenance:** 1-2 hours/month (can be automated)

## 🎯 Your First Hour

### Step 1: Choose Your Hardware (5 minutes)

**Option A: Old Laptop/Desktop (Recommended for Beginners)**
- ✅ Free (you already have it!)
- ✅ Enough power for learning
- ✅ Easy to set up
- Use it!

**Option B: Raspberry Pi**
- 💰 $50-150 purchase
- ✅ Low power consumption
- ⚠️ Limited performance
- Good for light services

**Option C: Buy/Build Server**
- 💰 $300-1500
- ✅ Best performance
- ⚠️ Do this later, after you know you like it

**Decision:** Start with what you have! You can always upgrade later.

### Step 2: Install Operating System (30 minutes)

**Recommended: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS**

Why?
- Free and open-source
- Most tutorials use it
- Long-term support
- Easy to use

**Installation:**
1. Download: [Ubuntu Server 22.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)
2. Create bootable USB: Use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie) (Windows) or [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) (Mac/Linux)
3. Boot from USB
4. Follow installer:
   - Language: English
   - Keyboard: Your layout
   - Network: Automatic (DHCP)
   - Storage: Use entire disk
   - Profile: Create user account
   - SSH: Enable OpenSSH server ← Important!
   - Packages: Skip for now
5. Reboot and login

**Alternative: Use Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac)**
- Download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- Install and run
- Skip Ubuntu installation
- Slightly different commands, but works!

### Step 3: Install Docker (10 minutes)

SSH into your server:
```bash
ssh username@your-server-ip
```

Run this script (copies and pastes all at once):
```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Install Docker Compose
sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin -y

# Log out and back in
exit
```

Log back in:
```bash
ssh username@your-server-ip
```

Verify installation:
```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

### Step 4: Deploy Your First Service - Portainer (15 minutes)

Portainer = Web UI for managing Docker

```bash
# Create directory
mkdir -p ~/homelab/portainer
cd ~/homelab/portainer

# Create docker-compose.yml
cat > docker-compose.yml << 'EOF'
version: '3'

services:
  portainer:
    image: portainer/portainer-ce:latest
    container_name: portainer
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - portainer_data:/data

volumes:
  portainer_data:
EOF

# Start Portainer
docker compose up -d

# Check it's running
docker ps
```

**Access Portainer:**
1. Open browser
2. Go to: `http://YOUR-SERVER-IP:9000`
3. Create admin account
4. Select "Docker" environment

**🎉 Congratulations!** You just deployed your first service!

## 🎓 What You Just Learned

Let's break down what happened:

### docker-compose.yml
This file is a "recipe" for your service:
```yaml
services:           # List of containers
  portainer:        # Name of service
    image: ...      # Which Docker image to use
    ports:          # Which ports to expose
    volumes:        # Where to store data
```

### docker compose up -d
This command:
- Reads the recipe (docker-compose.yml)
- Downloads the image (if needed)
- Creates and starts the container
- Runs it in background (`-d` = detached)

### Containers vs Images
- **Image:** Blueprint (like a recipe)
- **Container:** Running instance (like a cake from the recipe)

You can create many containers from one image!

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a domain name?
**Not required**, but recommended ($10/year).
- **Without:** Access via IP:port (e.g., 192.168.1.100:8096)
- **With:** Nice URLs (e.g., jellyfin.yourdomain.com)

### Can I use Windows/Mac?
**Yes!** Use Docker Desktop:
- Download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- Works great for learning
- Slightly different than Linux, but similar

### How much does electricity cost?
**Depends on hardware:**
- Raspberry Pi: $5-10/month
- Old laptop: $10-15/month
- Desktop: $15-25/month
- Server: $20-40/month

### Is this legal?
**Yes!** Self-hosting is 100% legal.
- Hosting your own services: ✅ Legal
- Using VPNs: ✅ Legal (in most countries)
- Piracy: ❌ Illegal (don't do it)

### What if something breaks?
**That's how you learn!**
- Check logs: `docker compose logs service-name`
- Google the error message
- Ask in r/homelab or r/selfhosted
- Worst case: Delete and recreate container

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Can't access service from browser
**Check:**
```bash
# Is container running?
docker ps

# Check logs
docker compose logs service-name

# Check firewall
sudo ufw status
```

### Port already in use
**Find what's using it:**
```bash
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :PORT
```

**Solution:** Stop the conflicting service or use different port

### Permission denied
**Add yourself to docker group:**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in
```

### Container won't start
**Check logs:**
```bash
docker compose logs service-name
```

Common causes:
- Port already in use
- Missing .env file
- Wrong file permissions
- Typo in docker-compose.yml
